# Intro

Currently, I am an RSDE working at Microsoft Research in Redmond. My research
interest is in building dependable software systems.

Before joining Microsoft, I worked at Samsung Research America in Smart System
Group.

I did my PhD at University of Chicago. I worked with [Prof. Haryadi
Gunawi](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~haryadi/) in [UCARE
group](http://ucare.cs.uchicago.edu/). My
[thesis](https://newtraell.cs.uchicago.edu/files/phd_paper/tanakorn.pdf)
focused on improving the dependability of cloud-scale distributed systems. My
expertise on this topic involves distributed concurrency bugs combating and
scalability checking.

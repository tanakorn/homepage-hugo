# Intro

I am a researcher working at [Samsung Research
America](http://www.sra.samsung.com/) in Smart System Group. My research
interests cover distributed systems, cloud computing, and IoT.

Previously, I did my PhD at University of Chicago. I worked with [Prof. Haryadi
Gunawi](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~haryadi/) in [UCARE
group](http://ucare.cs.uchicago.edu/). My
[thesis](https://newtraell.cs.uchicago.edu/files/phd_paper/tanakorn.pdf)
focused on improving the dependability of cloud-scale distributed systems. My
expertise on this topic involves distributed concurrency bugs combating and
scalability checking.
